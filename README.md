To load everything into your interpreter consult load.pl from the project root: `[load].`

To run the test suite you need [Crisp](https://github.com/khueue/crisp) (a tiny unit testing framework) and a compatible interpreter (see docs). Loading everything should look something like this: `[load, 'path/to/crisp.pl'].` Then run Crisp with `crisp.` and watch the tests fly by. The Makefile should provide some more guidance if needed.
